🎤 Voice-Based Deep Learning Chatbot
A voice-enabled chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. This system captures spoken user input, classifies it into predefined intents using a trained neural network, and responds through both text and voice.

🔧 Features
✅ 🎙️ Voice-to-text input using SpeechRecognition
✅ 🧠 Intent classification using a neural network (TensorFlow/Keras)
✅ 💬 Voice + text responses with pyttsx3 (offline TTS)
✅ 🌐 Optional Streamlit-based web interface for interactive demo
✅ 🗃️ Easily extendable intents.json for new skills and responses

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

NLTK – Natural Language Toolkit

TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning framework

SpeechRecognition – For voice input

pyttsx3 – Text-to-speech (TTS) for voice output

Streamlit – Web UI for demo (optional)

NumPy, Matplotlib – Data handling & visualization
