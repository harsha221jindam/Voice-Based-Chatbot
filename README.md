🎤 Voice-Based Deep Learning Chatbot
This project is a voice-enabled chatbot developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. The system interprets spoken user input, classifies it into predefined intents using a trained neural network model, and responds through both text and voice output.

🔧 Features
🎙️ Voice-to-text input using SpeechRecognition
🧠 Intent classification using a deep learning model (Keras + TensorFlow)
💬 Text and voice-based responses via pyttsx3
📊 Streamlit-based web interface for demo interaction (optional)
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
TensorFlow / Keras
SpeechRecognition
pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
Streamlit (optional UI)
NumPy, Matplotlib
